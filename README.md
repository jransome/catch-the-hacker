Developers 
- assigned a service at random in the daytime. each service gets 2-3 people
- goal is to get the hacker fired


Hacker(s) 
- know who the other hackers are
- assigned a service to work on in the daytime (maybe can choose?) (1 hacker per service)
- can choose to hack a service during the night
- goal is to hack a service 3 times (whereupon it will be destroyed)


Tech lead???? (v2)
- is not known to any of the players except themselves
- tech lead can immunise a service during the night, preventing a hack
- if a hack is attempted on an immunised service, the people assigned to that service will know, but this is NOT announced to the group by the game

Night
- hackers collude and decide whether to act. if they hack an unimmunised service, the service loses 33% health
- tech lead immunises a service. if that service is hacked, the hack fails and the service is not affected

Morning
- everyone gets a pagerduty alert if a service is broken (the service that the hacker broke)
- people discuss who they think the hacker is
- vote on who gets fired


Game ends when a service is hacked 3 times (hackers win) or the hackers are fired (CtM wins).
